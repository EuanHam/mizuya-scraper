# mizuya
This is Mizuya, a Matcha stock monitoring dashboard and API.
Built because checking Matcha sites everyday got tiring. So now it's automated!

To run the lambda function:
1. Configure the lambda zip
    ~~~sh
    chmod +x lambda.sh
    ./lambda.sh
    ~~~
2. Upload tea-scraper.zip to AWS Lambda


In development:
- API
- Dashboard
