Started writing docs:
I need something to be in the root of mizuya-api.com for when the zon reviews over the site to get production access to AWS SES (Simple Email Service)

For now I'm just going to do the public GET API endpoint docs... though I haven't done any auth for the "admin" POST or PATCH endpoints... i really need to get onto that and rate limiting

Anywho writing the docs I learned a new HTML tag, I can't say that everyday actually
`<pre>` is a tag for preformatted text which preserves the display in terms of white space or line breaks. I'm using this to display the json response for the GET API endpoints for example

-> Went through twilio, some other sms 
-> Back to AWS sandbox mode
